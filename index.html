				<h2>Soccer</h2>
					<p> <i>	
						I have played soccer since I am 5 years old. Whereas I started playing in a women's team in the USA, when moving to Spain, I played in a men's team. When living in Argentina i had the chance to participate in the World Cup of worldwide French schools organized by famous soccer player Lilian Thuram in Brasilia in 2014. Finally, when moving back to France I became captain of my city's female team. </i> </p>

					<h2>Music</h2>
						<p> <i>
							I have always had a soft spot for music. I play drums, the guitar and sing. Hence, I joined my school's choir and took part in the Encantar project in Tandil Argentina and enjoy singing while accompanying myself on the guitar. 	</i> </p>

					<h2>Art</h2>
						<p> <i>	
							I have a strong appetite for crafts such as painting, sculpting or photogrpahy. In this way I won first prizes in these categories as well as in creative writing in my school's annual art competitions. Additionally, during my time in Argentina I developed my own jewelry line: MadStyle Creation. In this way, I designed, made and sold my creations to make a monthly profit of about 100 euros through this entrepenurial project. </i> </p>

					<h2>Cooking</h2>
						<p> <i>	
							I am a foodie and enjoy baking and discovering new flavours. This is why I usually take the matter into my own hands and love trying new recipes although mostly I prefer inventing new ones. </i> </p>
